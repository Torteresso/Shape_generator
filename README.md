PRESENTATION
============

This is an old program when I was doing some Python, the idea is :

Start from a POLYGON --> For each segment, draw a perpendicular bisector of random lenght pointing outside the shape
--> Draw lines perpendicular to these new bisectors --> Their intersections form a new POLYGON --> Repeat

The system will eventually evolve to a final (stable?) POLYGON.

This explanation with word is hard to visualize but the program show great visualisation of the process with adjustable speed.

HOW TO USE IT
=============

If you want to test it, you should install these python librairies :  

* [Turtle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)
  
And then you can clone it in Visual Studio Community 2022. That's it ! :)
